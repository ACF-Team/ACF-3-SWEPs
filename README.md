# ACF-3 SWEPs

This is a pack of scripted weapons built on ACF-3.
You need that in order to use these, which you can get at: https://github.com/Stooberton/ACF-3.

Weapons all shoot some form of ACF bullet, and as such can interact with props the same way as SENT weapons in ACF-3.

This pack still has room for some improvement, as well as it is not perfect.
As such, if you find any bugs or other things, please make an issue in the Issues tab.

This also supports the Prone mod, when it comes to weapon stability.
