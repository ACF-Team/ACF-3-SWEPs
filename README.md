Requires [ACF-3](https://github.com/ACF-Team/ACF-3) and its dependencies to function.

Weapons all shoot some form of ACF bullet, and as such can interact with props the same way as SENT weapons in ACF-3.

This pack still has room for some improvement as well as it is not perfect.
As such, if you find any bugs or other things, please make an issue in the Issues tab.

This also supports the [Prone Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1100368137) when it comes to weapon stability.
